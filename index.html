      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        I am a 14-year-old student at Haileybury with professional experience as a church organist and a growing profile as a developer. My background combines high-level musical training with technical development skills. I am currently an organist at three churches, performing regularly in services and contributing to the musical life of each community. Alongside music, I am developing projects in web technologies and embedded systems, with a focus on creating scalable and functional solutions.
